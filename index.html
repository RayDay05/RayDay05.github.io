          <h4>Video Games</h4>
          <h5>Xbox for life</h5>
          <p>I used to be a self proclaimed professional gamer becuase i believed i was that good when i was younger (which i was) and sunk in huge amounts of hours into some games. Games i enjoy playing would be FPS games which are first person shooters and RTS games which are real time strategy games.</p>

          <h4>Pets</h4>
          <h5>Dogs or Cats?</h5>
          <p>I have both! I have a wonderful chocolate labrador named cody he's about 10 years old and i also have a super energetic cat named oreo (her fur is black on the sides and white in the middle just like an oreo!) she is barley 1 year old so shes keeps cody on the tip of his paws.</p>
